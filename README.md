# PAO - Predictive Analytics and Optimization
This repository contains my public programs and models (mostly optimization problems). These problems were solved by different techniques (using open-source solvers, commercial solvers or own modification/combination of already existing algorithms). 
## Table of contents:
* [ponderthis_july2019](ponderthis_july2019/README.md) - IBM monthly puzzle (large- and small-area knight's cycles)
* [ponderthis_september2019](ponderthis_september2019/README.md) - IBM monthly puzzle (five banknote denominations)
* [ponderthis_october2019](ponderthis_october2019/README.md) - IBM monthly puzzle (five banknotes II)

I'll try to keep this repository as updated as possible.
